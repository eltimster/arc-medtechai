The ARC Training Centre in Cognitive Computing for Medical Technologies is
aimed at creating a workforce that is expert in developing, applying and
interrogating artificial intelligence ("AI") applications in data-intensive medical
contexts, to facilitate the next generation of data-driven and machine
learning-based medical technologies. The Centre will provide a world-class
industry-driven research training environment for PhD students and
postdoctoral researchers, who will lead the medical technology industry into a
new era of data-driven personalised and precision medical devices and
applications, based on a combination of research, industry and entrepreneurial
skills they will acquire through the Centre.

The Centre is hosted at The University of Melbourne, in collaboration with Western Sydney University, RMIT University,
and the University of South Australia. The Centre's current industry partners are Seer Medical and Synchron.  IBM Research-Australia was a founding partner and was involved with the Centre till recently.  Domain and industry expertise is
provided by medical device manufacturer Medtronic, St Vincentâ€™s Hospital, the
Florey Institute of Neuroscience and Mental Health, Melbourne Academic Centre
for Health (MACH), and Cogstate.

Funding for the Centre is in the form of $4.1m from the Australian Research
Council under the Industrial Transformation Research Program, and $4.5m of
cash and in-kind support from the industry partners. This will fund 15 PhD
students and 5 full-time post-doc researchers over the 5 year duration of the
Centre. Students will be co-supervised by university-based academics and researchers from industry partners, and be physically hosted within the partner facilities for part of their candidature.
