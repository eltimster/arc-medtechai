title:  "Model Development and Low-power Deployment of Machine Learning for Epileptic Seizure Prediction,
and 
Neuro-inspired Machine Learning Approaches to Predicting/Modelling Epilepsy"
subtitle: "Stream 1"
---
Project 1 aims to develop and apply state-of-the-art machine learning approaches for epileptic seizure prediction and assessing the efficacy of epilepsy medication.  It will develop two types of new machine learning models: (i) Type I models will be designed to analyse multimodal time-series data for epileptic seizure prediction with a special focus on recurrent neural network models and EEG, time of day, and movement tracking data; (ii) Type II models will be designed to analyse medical patient records for assessing and improving the efficacy of epilepsy medication, by investigating correlations between administered medication and evidence on patient outcomes.

Project 2 aims to bring together neural models of the brain with machine learning to study and treat epilepsy. This project will develop patient-specific neural field models and neural mass models that replicate recorded EEG signals with high fidelity. The underlying model states and parameters will be used as inputs to machine learning algorithms to predict seizures and to elucidate the underlying mechanisms of epilepsy. This combined approach will help us to understand the causes and behaviours of epileptic seizures and build high fidelity models for epileptic seizure prediction.

content="<p>Professor David Grayden is the Clifford Chair of Neural Engineering in the Department of Biomedical Engineering, and Leader of the Bionics Laboratory in the Centre for Neural Engineering, Melbourne School of Engineering, The University of Melbourne.</p>
<p>Prof Grayden&#39;s main research interests are in understanding how the brain processes information, how best to present information to the brain using medical bionics, such as the bionic ear and bionic eye, and how to record information from the brain, such as for brain-machine interfaces. He is also conducting research in epileptic seizure prediction and electrical stimulation to prevent or stop epileptic seizures, and in electrical stimulation of the vagus nerve to control inflammatory bowel disease. He has research linkages with the Bionics Institute, St Vincent&#39;s Hospital Melbourne, Royal Melbourne Hospital, University of South Australia, Florey Institute for Neuroscience and Mental Health, and University of Maryland, USA.</p>"

company="The University of Melbourne"
content="<p>Professor Anthony (Tony) Burkitt holds the Chair in Bio-Signals and Bio-Systems in the Department of Biomedical Engineering at the University of Melbourne since 2007. His research encompasses a number of areas of neural engineering, including medical bionics, computational neuroscience, retinal-implant vision processing, cochlear-implant speech processing and bio-signal processing for epilepsy. His research has made significant contributions to understanding the behaviour and function of neural information processing in the brain and it has also been instrumental in the development of visual stimulation paradigms for retinal implants, new cochlear implant speech processing strategies, methods for detecting and predicting seizures, and the use of electrical stimulation for seizure abatement in epilepsy. He was the Director of Bionic Vision Australia (2010-2016), a Special Research Initiative in Bionic Vision Science and Technology of the Australian Research Council (ARC), and he successfully led the project though all of its phases: Project conception, securing $50million in ARC funding, the research and development programs that led to the development of a prototype bionic eye (suprachoroidal retinal implant), the successful implantation in three patients, and the establishment of the company Bionic Vision Technologies (BVT) with US$18million of venture capital for the ongoing commercial and clinical development of the technology.</p>"

role="Senior Research Fellow"
company="St Vincent’s Hospital, The University of Melbourne"
content="<p>Dr Freestone’s research is focused on reverse engineering the human brain. He is developing methods to create a mathematical blueprint of the brain, so engineering methods can be used to treat neurological disorders. His research findings are about to be trialled in a brain implant designed to predict and control epileptic seizures in collaboration with the medical device company Medtronic. He also works closely IBM Australia, where the team is creating specialised computer chips that can interface with the brain and bypass broken neural circuits.</p>
<p>Dr Freestone has a degree in Electronic Engineering from La Trobe University, where he won the Vice-Chancellor's Travelling Scholarship, the Tad Szental Prize for the best engineering final year student and the Hooper Memorial Prize for best final year project. In 2012, Dr Freestone completed his PhD in the Electrical and Electronic Engineering Department at the University of Melbourne (and The University of Edinburgh on exchange), where he won the John Melvin Memorial Scholarship for the best PhD in Engineering and the University wide Chancellor’s Prize for PhD Excellence. Dr Freestone was the 2014-2015 Victorian Fulbright Postdoctoral Fellow, where he worked in the Neural Statistics Lab at Columbia University in New York City, USA. He is now a junior faculty member in the Department of Medicine at St. Vincent’s Hospital Melbourne, since October 2015.</p>"
