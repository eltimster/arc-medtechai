Philippa (Pip) Karoly is working to develop an innovative, patient- specific approach to seizure forecasting. Using sophisticated computational techniques, long-term data from brain recordings, environmental, behavioural and physiological factors can be combined and converted into useful seizure likelihood models.

For three years, Pip also worked as a software engineer for the Australian medical technology company, Seer. At Seer she developed a mobile app that provides people with epilepsy insight into their seizure patterns. Now, her research combines this app data with wearable devices and neural implants to generate real-time insights into seizure likelihood. To achieve this goal, Pip maintains close ties with industry partners, providing the optimal balance to translate medical research into innovative clinical solutions
