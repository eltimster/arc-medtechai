My research focus lies in the intersection between the Natural Language Processing and Machine Learning fields. I am currently a Lecturer at the University of Melbourne, after two and a half years as a Research Fellow at the same university.

I did my Ph.D. at The University of Sheffield, where my research focus was on Bayesian Kernel Methods for NLP applications, especially models based on Gaussian Processes and kernels defined on structured objects.

In the past, I've done my M.Sc. studies in Syntax-based Statistical MT, wtih focus on the English-Portuguese language pair. During my undergraduate studies I worked with Lexical Acquistion, focused on Multiword Expressions. I also have some experience with Automatic Speech Recognition, especially on building language models.

I am a huge fan of Python and try to use it whenever possible. I have worked most with scientific toolkits like NLTK, Numpy, MatPlotLib and scikit-learn, and also the web scraping toolkit Scrapy.
