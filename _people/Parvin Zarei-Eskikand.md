I joined the ARC Training Centre in Cognitive Computing for Medical Technologies in July 2019 as a postdoctoral researcher to advance the current technology for predicting epileptic seizures.  My main research interest is in the area of computational neuroscience. I completed my PhD in 2017 in Department of Biomedical Engineering at The University of Melbourne, where I developed a computational model of the visual cortex particularly focusing on Medial Temporal area. Before joining ARC Training Centre, I worked as a postdoctoral researcher at the Department of Physiology of The University of Melbourne, where I developed a multiscale neural model of the enteric nervous system.
